# FriendFinder

### Overview

This is the 11th assignment for the Coding Bootcamp delivered at University of Toronto Mississauga.

In this assignment we were required to create a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application -- basically a dating app. This full-stack site will take in results from your users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

### Description

### How It Works

A user is required to enter their name and photo URL, then fill out a 10-question survey. Their survey answers are compared to other user's answers, and the user with which they have the least difference is selected as their most compatible friend. Once the current user's most compatible friend is found, the result is displayed as a modal pop-up. The modal should display both the name and picture of the closest match.

### Built With

- Node.js
- Express and Body Parser NPMs
- AJAX, jQuery, Javascript
- Bootstrap
